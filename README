This is the README file for version beta1.04 of the Taylor UUCP
package.  This is a beta release, and certainly contains various bugs.

WHAT IT IS

This is the complete source code for a Unix UUCP package.  It provides
everything you need to make a UUCP connection.  It includes versions
of uucico, uusched, uuxqt, uux, uucp, uustat, uulog, uuname, uuto,
uupick, and cu, as well as uuchk (a program to check configuration
files), uuconv (a program to convert from one type of configuration
file to another) and tstuu (a test harness for the package).

The Free Software Foundation plans to make this their standard UUCP
package.

The package currently supports the 'f', 'g' (in all window and packet
sizes), 'G', 't' and 'e' protocols, as well a Zmodem protocol and a
new bidirectional protocol.  If you have a Berkeley sockets library,
it can make TCP connections.  If you have TLI libraries, it can make
TLI connections.  It supports a new configuration file mechanism which
I like (but other people dislike).

The package has a few advantages over regular UUCP:

    You get the source code.

    It uses significantly less CPU time than many UUCP packages.

    You can specify a chat script to run when a system calls in,
    allowing adjustment of modem parameters on a per system basis.

    You can specify failure strings for chat scripts, allowing the
    chat script to fail immediately if the modem returns ``BUSY''.

    If you are talking to another instance of the package, you can use
    the new bidirectional protocol for rapid data transfer in both
    directions at once.  You can also restrict file transfers by size
    based on the time of day and who placed the call.

On the other hand:

    It only runs on Unix.  The code is carefully divided into system
    dependent and system independent portions, so it should be
    possible to port it to other systems.  It would not be trivial.

    You don't get uuclean, uusend, uuq, uusnap, uumonitor, uutry,
    uupoll, etc.  If you have current copies of these programs, you
    may be able to use them.  Shell scripts versions of uuclean and
    uutry are provided, with most, if not all, of the functionality of
    the usual programs.  I believe the supplied uustat program allows
    you to do everything that uuq, uusnap and uumonitor do.  uupoll
    could be written as a shell script.

    The package does not read modemcap or acucap files, although you
    can use V2 configuration files with a BNU Dialers file or a dialer
    file written in my new configuration file format.

    The package cannot use SCO dialer programs directly, although it
    can with a simple shell script interface.

If you start using this package, I suggest that you join the mailing
list (see above) to keep up to date on patches and new versions.  I am
also open to suggestions for improvements and modifications.

CHANGES SINCE 1.03

For a complete list, see ChangeLog.  The man pages and documentation
are only partially updated for the beta release of 1.04.

IMPORTANT: the default when talking to another version of 1.04 is to
use the new bidirectional 'i' protocol.  If you are using a
half-duplex modem, such as a Telebit T2500, you will want to either
mark the port as half-duplex with the ``half-duplex'' command, or
force use of the 'g' protocol by using the ``protocol'' command in the
sys or port file or by adding ``,g'' after the port name in the
Systems or L.sys or Devices file.

IMPORTANT: I don't think the timing code is quite correct.  Don't rely
on the statistics file entries in this beta release.  This will be
straightened out for the real release.

    As usual, many bugs were fixed.

    Bidirectional transfers are supported with the new 'i' protocol;
    it requires an eight-bit clear datapath.

    New programs: uusched, cu, uuto and uupick.

    The 'G' protocol and a new Zmodem protocol were added.

    A number of uustat options were added to support uuclean, and a
    sample uuclean shell script was added to the contrib directory.
    The uustat output formats were changed slightly.

    A protocol extension eliminates transfer of the command file for
    simple commands, such as rmail or rnews, when talking to another
    version of 1.04.

    TLI support was added.

    UUCP forwarding was added.

    If a file transfer fails in the middle, the retry will now start
    from where it left off.  The implementation is compatible with
    SVR4.

    The work queue is checked every 10 minutes during a conversation;
    if there is new work and a bidirectional protocol is not in use,
    the receiving uucico requests the sender to transfer control.

    The UUCP configuration file reading routines were moved into a
    standalone library, uuconf.  All known bugs in V2 and HDB
    configuration file reading were fixed.

    The ``half-duplex'' command was added for the port and dialer
    files.

    The ``max-retries'', ``success-wait'', ``send-request'' and
    ``receive-request'' commands were added for the sys file.  The
    ``call-request'' and ``called-request'' commands were eliminated
    (they did not work correctly anyhow).

    \d in chat scripts now calls sleep (2) rathern than sleep (1), so
    it will sleep longer (on some systems sleep(1) may delay much less
    than one second).

    SPOOLDIR_SVR4 was added for SVR4 style spool directories.

    Defaults are now permitted in the port and dialer files.

    The ALIAS field is supported in the HDB Permissions file.

DOCUMENTATION

The documentation is in the file uucp.texi, which is a Texinfo file.
Texinfo is a format used by the Free Software Foundation.  You can
print the documentation using TeX in combination with the file
texinfo.tex; neither are provided, but both are fairly readily
available in the texinfo package from the Free Software Foundation.
The beta release does not include formatted versions of the
documentation; they will be provided separately with the final release
of 1.04.

See the TODO file for things which should be done.  Please feel free
to do them, although you may want to check with me first.  Send me
suggestions for new things to do.

The compilation instructions are in uucp.texi.  Here is a summary.

    Edit Makefile.in to set installation directories.

    Type ``sh configure''.  You can pass a number of arguments in the
    environment (using bash or sh, enter something like ``CC=gcc
    configure''; using csh, enter something like ``setenv CC gcc; sh
    configure''):
        CC: C compiler to use; default is gcc if it exists, else cc
        DEFS: Flags to pass to $CC for configure testing only; default none
        CFLAGS: Flags to pass to $CC when compiling; default -g
        LDFLAGS: Flags to pass to $CC when only linking; default none
        LIBS: Library arguments to pass to $CC; default none
        INSTALL: Install program; default install -c or cp
        INSTALLDATA: Install data; default install -c -m 0644 or cp
    The configure script will compile a number of test programs to see
    what is available on your system, so if your system is at all
    unusual you will need to pass in $CC and $LIBS correctly.

    The configure script will create conf.h from conf.h.in and
    Makefile from Makefile.in.  It will also create config.status,
    which is a shell script; if configure gets a couple of things
    wrong, you can correct them in config.status and do ``sh
    config.status'' to redo the configuration.  Please report any such
    problems, so that they can be fixed in later versions.

    Examine conf.h and Makefile to make sure they're right.

    Edit policy.h for your local system.    

    Type ``make''.

    Use ``uuchk'' to check configuration files.

    Type ``make install'' to install.
