This is the README file for release 1.02 of the Taylor UUCP package.

It was written by Ian Lance Taylor.  I can be reached at ian@airs.com,

There is a mailing list for discussion of the package.  To join the
list, send a message to taylor-uucp-request@gnu.ai.mit.edu.  Make sure
you include the address you want to receive messages at; do not rely
on the From: header.  To send a message to the list, send it to

This package is covered by the Gnu Public License.  See the file
COPYING for details.  If you would like to do something with this
package that you feel is reasonable but you feel is prohibited by the
license, contact me to see if we can work it out.

WHAT IT IS

This is the complete source code for a basic UUCP package.  It
includes the programs uucico, uuxqt, uux and uucp, as well as uuchk (a
program to check configuration files) and tstuu (a test harness for
the package).

The package currently supports the 'f', 'g' (in all window and packet
sizes), 't' and 'e' protocols.  If you have a Berkeley sockets
library, it can make TCP connections.  It supports a new configuration
file mechanism which I like (but other people dislike).

The package has a few features not supplied by regular UUCP:

    You can specify a chat script to run when a system calls in,
    allowing adjustment of modem parameters on a per system basis.

    You can specify failure strings for chat scripts, allowing the
    chat script to fail immediately if the modem returns ``BUSY''.

    If you are talking to another instance of the package, you can
    restrict file transfers by size based on the time of day and who
    placed the call.

On the other hand:

    You don't get uulog, uustat, uusched, etc.  I hope to provide
    uustat in the next release, and uulog is pretty simple so it might
    get in there too.  If you have current copies of these programs,
    you may be able to use them.

    The package does not read modemcap or acucap files, although you
    can use V2 configuration files with a BNU Dialers file or a dialer
    file written in my new configuration file format.

    The package cannot use BNU dialer programs directly, although it
    can with a simple shell script interface.

If you start using this package, I suggest that you join the mailing
list (see above) to keep up to date on patches and new versions.  I am
also open to suggestions for improvements and modifications.

CHANGES SINCE 1.01

For a complete list, see ChangeLog.

    Many bugs were fixed.

    Many configuration options were added.

    The 'e' protocol was added.

    The default protocol ordering was changed to 't', 'e', 'g', 'f'.

    The package can now generate BNU (HDB) and V2 style log files.

    Chat scripts can now request eight bit characters, although by
    default input characters will be stripped to seven bits.

    The modem complete and abort strings can now be specified as chat
    scripts.

    The uuxqt daemon was changed to by default not send mail messages.

    Failed file transfers are now recorded in the statistics file.

    A new 'g' protocol parameter ``errors'' was added, to set the
    maximum number of errors permitted before the connection is
    dropped.

    Statistics file entries are now kept in fractions of a second.

    The format of the log and statistics files was changed to include
    the year and the time down to hundredths of a second.

    The debugging level can be set for a specific system.

    A '#' can now appear in a configuration file if it is preceded by
    a backslash; this will quietly change the meaning of any current
    configuration files which contain the sequence "\#".

    The 'g' and 'f' protocols now log informative messages about the
    amount of data transferred when they finish.

    The ``Call complete'' message includes the conversation length.
