Things to do for the Taylor UUCP package.  This list includes some of
my thoughts, but is mostly suggestions from the net.  They are in no
particular order.  Some of the numbers that were in here have been
removed.

Of course, getdate() accepts a single date, but we want a range.  A
better syntax would be certainly be nice.

John R MacMillan <chance!john@sq.sq.com> mentions the HDB notion of
services; something like this should be added whenever I get around to
writing a version of cu.

T. William Wells <bill@twwells.com> suggests making the dialer
``complete'' and ``abort'' commands into chat scripts, rather than
simple strings.

Gordon Burditt <gordon@sneaky.lonestar.org> warns about modifications
to the TZ environment variable, to fool uucico into dialing out at an
inappropriate time.

There should be some way for chat scripts to specify the parity to
expect and to generate.

15.

There may need to be a compile time switch to determine the behaviour
of the -z switch to uux.

16.

The -j switch to uucp and uux does nothing.  As far as I can tell, the
traditional uustat does not attempt to remove all files associated
with a particular uucp or uux request, but just one of them.  Is it
worth it to keep a list of files in files in another special directory
(/usr/spool/uucp/.Requests) to make uustat complete and easy to
implement?

17.

The -b and -s switches to uux are not implemented by uuxqt.

18.

If we are supposed to call a system back, we should do it immediately
rather than merely queuing up an empty command file.

19.

Should there be some way to specify the retry time and the maximum
number of retries using the new configuration scheme?  The retry time
can currently be specified by using a semicolon at the end of a time
string.
