Things to do for the Taylor UUCP package.  This list includes some of
my thoughts, but is mostly suggestions from the net.  They are in no
particular order.  Some of the numbers that were in here have been
removed.

Of course, getdate() accepts a single date, but we want a range.  A
better syntax would be certainly be nice.

John R MacMillan <chance!john@sq.sq.com> mentions the HDB notion of
services; something like this should be added whenever I get around to
writing a version of cu.

Gordon Burditt <gordon@sneaky.lonestar.org> warns about modifications
to the TZ environment variable, to fool uucico into dialing out at an
inappropriate time.

Should there be a way for chat scripts to specify the parity to
generate?  I don't think there's much point to specifying what parity
to accept.

16.

The -j switch to uucp and uux does nothing.  As far as I can tell, the
traditional uustat does not attempt to remove all files associated
with a particular uucp or uux request, but just one of them.  Is it
worth it to keep a list of files in files in another special directory
(/usr/spool/uucp/.Requests) to make uustat complete and easy to
implement?

17.

The -b and -s switches to uux are not implemented by uuxqt.

18.

If we are supposed to call a system back, we should do it immediately
rather than merely queuing up an empty command file.

19.

Should there be some way to specify the retry time and the maximum
number of retries using the new configuration scheme?  The retry time
can currently be specified by using a semicolon at the end of a time
string.

20.

Write some protocols that support bidirectional transfers.

21.

Support transfers through systems using uucp and uux.  Implement the
``forward-to'' command to allow control of these transfers.

22.

Add an ftp port type which uses anonymous ftp rather than any of the
UUCP protocols to do file transfers.  This would allow ftp work to be
done late at night.

23.

If we don't permit command execution, we still want to delete the work
files we've been given for the command.

24.

Running uucico as a TCP server doesn't work because only root can bind
a port less than 1024.  This is checked by effective user id, and our
effective user id is always uucp.  If we have saved set user id we
could switch the effective user id to root and then back again;
otherwise we have to not use setuid and start the program as root.
Actually, we could use another program to start as root, bind the
port, and invoke uucico.  That may be the required solution.

31.

David Nugent: add a -C option to uucico to only call the system if
there was work to do.

32.

It would be nice if uucico could sleep until a line was available.
This is complicated by the possibility of wanting to wait for any of
several different lines, and one would really want some sort of
semaphore function to do it right.  If the available lines could be
sorted, then each could be assigned to a byte in a line lock file.
Looking for a line could be done by sleeping on a read lock on all
possible lines.  Once it came through, write locks would be attempted.
If they all failed, somebody else snuck in, so you would sleep on a
read lock again.  This isn't great because a process could be starved,
but it might be better than nothing.

This could be tied in to uucp and uux, such that they wouldn't
actually fire up uucico unless a line was known to be available; an
additional switch would be used to fire up uucico anyhow (or one could
switch the default behaviour and the switch).

So how do you sort the lines?  You could just use the index in the
port (or Devices) file, but what if multiple ports used the same
physical device?  Hmmm.

33.

David Nugent: allow the minimum wait time to be specified for a
system, such that calls to that system are not made more frequently
than, say, once an hour.

34.

Bob Izenberg: HDB UUCP will retry a call once if it fails.  I might
want some sort of configuration parameter to allow calls to be
retried.  This can be done by adding an alternate and repeating the
phone number, though.

35.

Terry Gardner: there's no way to embed a # character in a phone
number.

36.

David Nugent: add an option to uuxqt to allow a nice value to be
specified.  It's hard to do from a shell script because some systems
don't permit shell scripts to be executed via execl.

43.

David Nugent: it would be nice to be able to set debugging, log, and
statistics files on a site by site basis.

58.

Lele Gaifax: put the complete year in the log file.

59.

John Theus: use getwd as an option for getcwd.

61.

Add bcopy, etc., for the mem functions.

62.

Add index, rindex for strchr, strrchr.

63.

Marty Shannon: use getenv ("HZ") for TIMES_TICK.

64.

Franc,ois Pinard: if 'g' protocol sends to something which echoes
everything, it will never get out of fgwait_for_packet.

65.

Monty Solomon: add an option to use ``union wait'' as the argument to
wait(2).

66.

Monty Solomon: getopt.c defines bcopy and index.
