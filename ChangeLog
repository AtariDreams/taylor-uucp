Tue Jan 21 14:37:10 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* Released version 1.02.

	* system.h, uucico.c (main), uux.c (main), uucp.c (main,
	zcone_system), sys1.unx (fsysdep_run): Chip Salzenberg: have uucp
	and uux start up uucico -s system rather than uucico -r1.

Mon Jan 20 11:45:38 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* sys1.unx (fsysdep_make_dirs): don't try to create a directory
	with no name.

	* version.c: change version number to 1.02.

	* uucico.8, uuxqt.8, uucp.1, uux.1: change version number to 1.02.

	* MANIFEST: removed texinfo.tex; it's twice the size of any other
	file, so I think it's just to large to distribute.

	* uucico.c (fcall, fdo_call): Marty Shannon: update the time in
	the .Status file if it's the wrong time to call, and upon
	receiving a call.

Sun Jan 19 13:29:23 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* protg.c (fgsendcmd, fgsenddata): Dave Platt: if the remote UUCP
	accepts packets larger than 64 bytes, assume it can handle
	differing packet sizes, so if we have a small amount of data to
	send, use a small packet.  Besides the two routines mentioned,
	also made minor changes to other routines to get the packet length
	out of the packet data rather than always assuming the same packet
	size.

	* conf.h, uucp.h: Matthew Lyle: some systems don't declare errno
	in <errno.h>, so I added HAVE_ERRNO_DECLARATION.

	* conf.h, uucp.h, util.c (bsearch): added HAVE_BSEARCH
	configuration parameter.

Sat Jan 18 17:45:28 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* tstuu.c (utransfer): Mike Park: don't sleep when the input
	buffer is full; it's too slow.

	* Makefile: when making a distribution,change the mode of separate
	copies of the configuration files Makefile, conf.h and sysh.unx.

	* uucico.c (faccept_call): Marty Shannon: update .Status file on
	incoming calls.

	* uucp.h, prot.h, uucico.c (fuucp), prot.c (fsend_file,
	fpsendfile_confirm, freceive_file, fprecfile_confirm, fxcmd,
	ustats_failed), file.c (fsent_file, usendfile_error,
	freceived_file, urecfile_error, frecfile_rewind, fmail_transfer):
	reworked calls to fsydep_did_work and sending of mail messages to
	be more sensible.  Now sends mail to requestor if request fails
	permanently and does not remove file if request fails only
	temporarily.

Thu Jan 16 11:33:08 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* protg.c (fgsendcmd, fgsenddata): zero out unused bytes in short
	packets.

	* prot.c (zgetcmd), protf.c (ffsendcmd), prott.c (ftsendcmd),
	prote.c (fesendcmd): Niels Baggesen: added some debugging
	messages.

	* protg.c (fgsendcmd): corrected misspelling in debugging message.

	* log.c (ustats): Niels Baggesen: add FAILED to end of xferstats
	line if appropriate.

	* uuxqt.c (uqdo_xqt_file): Niels Baggesen: was checking strcmp
	return value incorrectly, so messages to other systems were not
	being sent.

	* sys2.unx, tstuu.c: Mike Park: ioctl is sometimes declared
	varadic, so we can't declare it.

Wed Jan 15 02:03:43 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* sys1.unx: put \n at end of fsysdep_run error message.

	* sysh.unx, sys1.unx, sys2.unx, tstuu.c: Mike Park: on some
	systems <sys/time.h> includes <time.h> but <time.h> can only be
	included once; added HAVE_SYS_TIME_AND_TIME_H to sysh.unx.

	* tstuu.c: Mike Park: removed prototype for times since some
	systems don't have clock_t.

	* conf.h, sys2.unx, util.c: Mike Park: some systems don't have
	<limits.h>.  Every macro used from it already had a check to make
	sure it was defined anyhow.

	* tstuu.c (uprepare_test): Mike Park: sh on NeXT interprets a
	leading ~, so we have to quote the argument to system(3).
	Incredible.

	* conf.h, uucp.h: Mike Park: if HAVE_ALLOCA is 0 when compiling
	with gcc, don't define alloca as a macro.  This will let the NeXT
	define it in some header file.

	* sysh.unx, sys2.unx, sys5.unx, tstuu.c: Mike Park: handle
	HAVE_UNION_WAIT completely.  Assume that system(3) returns an int
	which should be put into the w_status field.  Define macros for
	union wait if they are not already defined.  Move all this stuff
	into sysh.unx rather than duplicating it in three different files.

	* conf.h, uucp.h, sysh.unx, config.c, bnu.c, v2.c, uucico.c,
	uuxqt.c, uux.c, uucp.c, uuchk.c, Makefile: set directory to look
	for configuration files in in Makefile rather than in sysh.unx.
	This forced a number of changes, as now all new style
	configuration files are looked up using NEWCONFIGLIB.  Old style
	configuration files are looked up using OLDCONFIGLIB.

Mon Jan 13 00:35:43 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* sys3.unx: David Nugent: don't declare chmod, since it may be
	prototyped to take an argument that is smaller than an int.

	* uucico.c (faccept_call): Chip Salzenberg: only declare sportinfo
	if it will be used (if HAVE_TAYLOR_CONFIG is true).

	* sys3.unx (isysdep_get_sequence): Chip Salzenberg: avoid use
	before set warning from gcc.

	* protf.c (ffprocess_data): Chip Salzenberg: avoid use before set
	warning from gcc.

	* sysh.unx, sys2.unx (fsserial_read, usysdep_pause): Chip
	Salzenberg: added HAVE_USLEEP configuration parameter for the AIX
	usleep routine.

	* uuchk.c, prtinf.c, config.c: Chip Salzenberg: strcmp is a macro
	on AIX, so avoid declaring it and undef it in config.c where we
	want to declare it because we want to take its address.

	* uucp.h, sys3.unx (fsysdep_get_status, fsysdep_set_status): Chip
	Salzenberg: handle out of range status codes in status files.

	* Makefile, sysh.unx: defined LIBDIR in the Makefile, rather than
	forcing the user to define it in two different places.

	* sys.unx, tstuu.c: Chip Salzenberg: can't declare execl, since it
	is varadic.

	* sys1.unx, sys2.unx, sys3.unx, sys5.unx, tstuu.c: David Nugent:
	can't declare open or fcntl, since they may use ... in header file
	prototype; added declaration for popen; added casts of first mkdir
	argument to char *.

	* sysh.unx, tstuu.c (uchild): Mike Park: added HAVE_WAITPID and
	HAVE_WAIT4 configuration parameters to allow the use of wait4 as
	found on the NeXT.

	* tstuu.c (uprepare_test): Mike Park: use IPUBLIC_DIRECTORY_MODE
	rather than S_IRWXU | S_IRWXG | S_IRWXO.

	* sysinf.c (tisystem): Mike Park: ulog was being passed the wrong
	number of arguments.

Sun Jan 12 14:32:47 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* Eliminated CONFIG, INSTALL and THANKS.  They are now included in
	uucp.texi.  Changed README and MANIFEST accordingly.  Added
	uucp.info* and texinfo.tex to MANIFEST.

	* Makefile, uucp.texi: renamed taylor.texi to uucp.texi.

	* uucico.c (fcall, fdo_call): John Antypas: pass in sportinfo
	structure for fdo_call to use for an unknown port.

	* log.c (ulog): allocate enough bytes to name file if
	HAVE_BNU_LOGGING is in use but zLogfile has no %s.

Sat Jan 11 12:11:56 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* Makefile: changed to correspond to GNU standards, according to
	standards.text of 24 Nov 91.

	* Makefile: Franc,ois Pinard: use $(INSTALL_PROGRAM) and
	$(INSTALL) rather than cp to install the programs.

	* time.c (ftime_now), sys1.unx (usysdep_localtime): John Antypas:
	use memcpy to get the result of localtime rather than relying on
	structure assignment.

	* sysh.unx, prtinf.c: Hannu Strang: changed definition of
	SYSDEP_STDIN_CMDS to pass structure instead of address of
	structure to avoid bug in AIX compiler which causes it to fail to
	recognize an address constant containing the -> operator.

Tue Jan  7 10:22:43 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* Released beta 1.02.

	* protg.c (fgcheck_errors): discount out of order packets in the
	total error count, and allow a negative error count to mean that
	any number of errors are accepted.

	* sysinf.c (tadd_proto_param): Niels Baggesen: allocate number of
	protocol parameters based on *pc, not sIhold.cproto_params.

Sat Jan  4 16:42:21 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* log.c (ulog): tweaked HAVE_V2_LOGGING slightly.

	* v2.c (uv2_read_systems): set chat script correctly.

	* uucp.h, sys3.unx: avoid redefining SEEK_SET if it appears in
	<unistd.h> but not <stdio.h>.

	* chat.c (fcsend): made fcsend into a static function.

	* uucp.h, uucico.c, uuxqt.c, uux.c, uucp.c, uuchk.c, version.c:
	changed abProgram and abVersion from const char [] to char []
	because the Microsoft compiler on SCO can't handle const char []
	arrays correctly.

	* uux.c (main): allocate enough space for log message.

	* sys1.unx (usysdep_localtime): to get the current time, we can't
	call usysdep_full_time if the latter uses times.

	* sys1.unx, sys3.unx: added a couple more extern definitions for
	SCO 3.2.2.

	* uucico.c (main): start uuxqt even if a call fails.

	* sysh.unx, system.h, uuxqt.c (uqdo_xqt_file), sys5.unx
	(fsysdep_xqt_check_file): Chip Salzenberg: added configuration
	option ALLOW_FILENAME_ARGUMENTS to permit arguments that look like
	filenames, to allow undoing the patch I just made.

Fri Jan  3 00:44:59 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* system.h, uuxqt.c (uqdo_xqt_file), sys5.unx
	(fsysdep_xqt_check_file): David J. Fiander: make sure that if an
	argument looks like a filename we are permitted to access it.

	* sys3.unx (fsdo_lock): remove temporary file if link fails in
	fsdo_lock.

Thu Jan  2 00:01:53 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* protg.c (fgstart, fgshutdown, fgprocess_data): count remote
	rejections separately from resent packets when counting errors.

Tue Dec 31 14:31:38 1991  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* protg.c (fgstart): Franc,ois Pinard: forgot to initialize
	cGdelayed_packets.

	* prot.h, uucico.c, prote.c: added the 'e' protocol, creating the
	new file prote.c

	* prot.c (freceive_data), protf.c (fffile), prott.c (ftfile):
	changed pffile protocol entry point to pass number of bytes being
	sent; fixed bug in freceive_data which caused to ask for the wrong
	number of bytes when the buffer was empty.

Mon Dec 30 23:16:48 1991  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* sys2.unx (fsserial_open): Chip Salzenberg: don't turn on IXON
	and IXOFF initially; after all, the initialization packets might
	contain an XOFF character.

Sun Dec 29 00:00:42 1991  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* uucp.h, prot.c (fploop): John Theus: check for EOF before
	reading from file to work around bug in Tektronix library.

	* protg.c (fprocess_data): don't send RR packets when an error
	occurs; the other side will probably ignore them, and it may
	confuse some Telebit modems.

	* sys1.unx (usysdep_localtime): don't take the address of a cast
	value.

	* log.c (zldate_and_time): wasn't allocating enough buffer space.

Sat Dec 28 01:09:58 1991  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* uuxqt.c (uqdo_xqt_file): forgot to initialize zmail.

	* uucp.h, time.c, copy.c, sys1.unx, sys2.unx, sys3.unx, sys4.unx,
	sys5.unx, config.c, log.c, uuxqt.c, uux.c, tstuu.c: added a bunch
	of externs to decrease the number of implicit function
	definitions.

	* system.h, sys1.unx (usysdep_localtime), log.c (zldate_and_time):
	Lele Gaifax: put the full year in the log file, using the format
	YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.HH (ending in hundredths of seconds).

	* config.c (uprocesscmds): Terry Gardner: allow a # to be quoted
	in a configuration file.  Also made uprocesscmds reentrant.

	* sysh.unx, sys2.unx (fsrun_chat), sys5.unx (fsysdep_execute),
	tstuu.c (uchild): Monty Solomon: added HAVE_UNION_WAIT
	configuration option to pass a variable of type union wait to the
	wait and waitpid system calls.

	* sysh.unx, sys1.unx (usysdep_initialize): John Theus: added
	HAVE_GETWD to use getwd instead of getcwd.

	* sysh.unx, sys1.unx (usysdep_full_time): added HAVE_FTIME
	configuration option.

	* tstuu.c (uchild): use TIMES_TICK from sysh.unx rather than
	CLK_TCK.

	* conf.h, uucp.h, util.c, getopt.c, tstuu.c: added HAVE_STRCHR and
	HAVE_INDEX to conf.h.

Fri Dec 27 01:00:41 1991  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* uucico.c (fuucp): set fmasterdone correctly when running as a
	slave.

	* port.c (cpshow, upshow, fport_read, fport_write, fport_io):
	cleaned up debugging code by isolating out upshow and by making
	cpshow handle backslash.

	* tstuu.c (uprepare_test): create spool directories by hand, to
	make sure test 6 can be done and to test creating needed
	directories.

	* conf.h, uucp.h, bnu.c, v2.c, chat.c, protg.c, prott.c, sysinf.c,
	tcp.c, getopt.c, tstuu.c, util.c: added HAVE_MEMFNS and HAVE_BFNS
	to conf.h.  Changed memset calls to use bzero.

	* protg.c (fgcheck_errors, fgprocess_data): added protocol
	parameter ``errors'' to set maximum number of errors permitted.
	Also made fgprocess_data only reply once per batch of data.

Thu Dec 26 17:54:54 1991  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* tcp.c (ftcp_dial, itcp_port_number): Monty Solomon: cast
	arguments to avoid prototype errors on NeXT.

Mon Dec 23 00:16:19 1991  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* uucp.h, sysinf.c, uucico.c (main, flogin_prompt, faccept_call),
	uuchk.c (main): David Nugent: allow debugging level to be set for
	a specific system.

Sun Dec 22 15:51:10 1991  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* conf.h, uucp.c, sysh.unx, tcp.c, sys1.unx, sys2.unx, sys3.unx,
	sys5.unx, sys6.unx, tstuu.c: Monty Solomon: added HAVE_UNISTD_H to
	conf.h for systems which don't have <unistd.h>.  Also added
	externs for all functions from <unistd.h>, which required adding
	definitions for pid_t, uid_t and off_t to sysh.unx.

	* config.c, prtinf.c, time.c, uuchk.c: added externs for
	strcasecmp or strncasecmp, to avoid implicit function definitions
	now that I took the prototypes out of uucp.h.

	* sys3.unx (fsysdep_get_status): Franc,ois Pinard: the code added
	to avoid scanf had a stupid bug.

	* uucp.h: Monty Solomon: removed prototypes for strcasecmp and
	strncasecmp from uucp.h, since they may be in string.h.

Sat Dec 21 16:04:58 1991  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* uucp.h, uucico.c (ucatch), prot.c (fpsendfile_confirm,
	fprecfile_confirm, ustats_failed), file.c (fsent_file,
	freceived_file), log.c (ustats): Terry Gardner: record failed file
	transfers in the statistics file.

	* uucico.c: change protocol ordering to 't', 'g', 'f'.

	* uucico.c (faccept_call), tstuu.c (uprepare_test): John Theus:
	don't warn if the port file doesn't exist when the slave mode
	uucico looks up the port.

	* sys1.unx, sys5.unx: moved fsysdep_file_exists from sys5.unx to
	sys1.unx so that uucico can call it.

	* uux.c: Fran,cois Pinard: remove parentheses from ZSHELLSEPS so
	that they may be used to quote arguments as documented.  This
	means that may not be used to start subshell, but that is no great
	loss.

	* uux.c (main): use ulog to report illegal grade error message.

	* sys1.unx (fsysdep_run): use the real program name from abProgram
	in the error messages in fsysdep_run.

Thu Dec 19 19:02:28 1991  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* uucico.c (fdo_call, faccept_call): Terry Gardner: put the length
	of the conversation in the ``Call complete'' log file message.

	* uux.c: added space and tab to ZSHELLSEPS, because otherwise the
	command was parsed to include whitespace.

	* protg.c, protf.c: Oleg Tabarovsky: added statistical logging
	messages to the 'g' and 'f' protocols.  These go to the main log
	file right now, but I'm not sure if that's appropriate.

	* sys2.unx (fsserial_set): don't change terminal settings if we
	don't have to.

	* port.c (fport_io): add complete diagnostics for fport_io so we
	can see every byte that goes in or out.

	* uucico.c (fuucp): don't give user name in errors produced by
	getting the next command.

	* uuxqt.c (main): don't process execute files for unknown systems.
	This is not unreasonable, I hope, and it avoids errors caused by
	an uninitialized sUnknown structure.

	* sys4.unx (fsysdep_get_work_init): sort the previously found
	files all together so we can correctly check new files using
	bsearch.

	* protf.c (pfprocess, pfprocess_data, pfwait): Franc,ois Pinard:
	don't kill 'f' protocol because of an illegal byte.  Also slightly
	optimized the protocol to wait for up to seven characters at a
	time rather than just one.

Wed Dec 18 00:12:42 1991  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* sysh.unx, sys2.unx, tstuu.c: Terry Gardner: added
	USE_FOR_UNBLOCKED configuration parameter to support systems that
	don't permit O_NONBLOCK and O_NDELAY to both be set.

	* tstuu.c (uchild): give the uucico processes a chance to die on
	their own rather than killing them immediately.

	* uuxqt.c (main, uqdo_xqt_file): David Nugent: keep rescanning the
	list of execute files until nothing can be done.  Also, don't
	remove the execute file if we get some sort of internal error.

	* sys4.unx (fsysdep_get_work, usysdep_get_work_free): David
	Nugent: after we've processed all the work files we found
	initially, rescan the work directory to pick up any that may have
	come in in the meantime.  Also, reset iSwork_file to 0 in
	usysdep_get_work_free so that we can handle more than one system.

	* tstuu.c, uucico.c (main, fwait_for_calls, flogin_prompt): added
	-l option to uucico to prompt for the login name and password once
	and then exit.

Tue Dec 17 00:24:41 1991  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* uucp.h, uucico.c, uuxqt.c, uux.c, uucp.c, config.c
	(uread_config), log.c (ulog): eliminated ulog_program and added
	abProgram and ulog_to_file.  Made log messages output to stderr
	more Unix like.

	* log.c (ulog): use a fixed number of fields in a log file message
	by replacing a missing system or user with '-'.

	* port.h, chat.c (renamed fchat_send to fcsend), bnu.c
	(fbnu_read_dialer_info), prtinf.c (tpcomplete), sys2.unx
	(fsysdep_modem_close), uuchk.c (ukshow_dialer): T. William Wells:
	change the modem complete and abort strings into chat scripts.

	* sys2.unx (fsserial_open): on BSD start in RAW mode to avoid
	dropping characters when we switch over.  I originally thought
	being able to use XON/XOFF was worth the risk; I no longer think
	so.

	* tstuu.c (uprepare_test): have shell script sleep before printing
	the login name to make sure the second system has finished
	flushing its input buffer.

	* protg.c (fginit_sendbuffers), prott.c (ftsendcmd): David Nugent:
	avoid sending confidential information by zeroing out memory
	buffers before using them.

	* sysinf.c (tirequest, titransfer), prtinf.c (tpseven_bit,
	tpreliable, tpdtr_toggle): Marc Unangst: several functions did not
	accept true and false as boolean strings, contradicting the
	documentation.

	* uucp.h, system.h, sysh.unx, sys1.unx (usysdep_full_time), file.c
	(fstore_sendfile, fsent_file, fstore_recfile, freceived_file),
	log.c (ustats): generate statistics in microseconds instead of
	seconds for more accurate time keeping.

	* sys2.unx (fsserial_open): David Nugent: flush pending input
	when a serial port is opened.  This will clear out a
	NO\sCARRIER string left by a previous dropped connection.

Mon Dec 16 11:26:17 1991  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* uucico.c (main), uuxqt.c (main), tstuu.c (main, uchild): David
	Nugent: ignore SIGHUP in uucico and uuxqt, so that they are
	unaffected by the parent shell closing down and by the remote
	terminal dropping the connection.

	* bnu.c (ubnu_read_sysfiles, ubnu_read_systems, fbnu_find_port,
	fbnu_read_dialer_info): Mike Bernson: ignore lines that begin with
	whitespace, fix compilation error.	

Sat Dec 14 20:59:10 1991  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* sys2.unx (fsserial_open): don't turn on ISTRIP initially.

	* uucp.h, sysinf.c, chat.c (icexpect), uuchk.c (ukshow_chat):
	added chat-seven-bit command to allow control over whether
	parity bits are stripped out of chat scripts.

	* uucp.h, port.h, chat.c (fchat, fcprogram),
	config.c (tprocess_one_cmd), prtinf.c,
	sysinf.c (tichat, tprocess_chat_cmd),
	bnu.c (fbnu_read_dialer_info), port.c (fpdo_dial),
	uucico.c (fdo_call, faccept_call) uuchk.c (ukshow_chat):
	changed processing of chat commands to go through
	tprocess_chat_cmd, avoiding repetition.  All chat script
	information is now held in an schat_info structure.
	Eliminated the fchat_program function, renaming it fcprogram
	and making it static to chat.c (it is now called via fchat).
	Added CMDTABTYPE_PREFIX.  Added INIT_CHAT macro to initialize
	chat script information.  Added TTYPE_CMDTABTYPE and
	CARGS_CMDTABTYPE to eliminate hex constants in
	tprocess_one_cmd.

	* sys5.unx (zsysdep_get_xqt): Oleg Tabarovsky: don't stop
	processing files just because opendir failed on one; it could just
	be because we don't have read permission.

Fri Dec 13 17:43:52 1991  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* config.c (uprocesscmds): don't continually allocate and free the
	array of arguments.

Thu Dec 12 12:46:01 1991  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* prot.c (fgetcmd): Franc,ois Pinard: don't bother to give an
	error if the final HY doesn't come in; apparently the MtXinu UUCP
	doesn't send it.

	* chat.c (icexpect, fchat_send): Franc,ois Pinard: add some chat
	script debugging messages.

	* log.c (ulog): David Nugent: move ERROR: from the start of the
	line to after the date and time; this makes it easier to use awk
	on log files.

	* sys3.unx (fsdo_lock), sys1.unx (usysdep_initialize): do locking
	using link rather than O_CREAT | O_EXCL to avoid race conditions
	and to safely run as the superuser.

	* sys3.unx (fsysdep_move_file): fcopyfile now creates the
	destination file with IPRIVATE_MODE, so we don't need to chmod to
	it.

	* sys1.unx (usysdep_initialize, fsysdep_other_config): set the
	GID as well as the UID, in case anybody wants to run this as a
	setgid package.

Wed Dec 11 10:03:22 1991  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* conf.h, uucp.h, util.c (strtol): Mark Powell: added my own
	version of strtol to util.c, for systems which lack it.

	* protg.c (fgstart, fgexchange_init): if we start resending
	packets during initialization, don't forget which packets we have
	already seen; otherwise the other side may assume we've already
	seen them while we're looking for them.

Tue Dec 10 15:42:41 1991  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* conf.h, sysh.unx, log.c (ulog, ustats), tstuu.c (uprepare_test):
	Arne Ludwig: merged in Arne Ludwig's patches to support V2 and BNU
	style logging, with some minor additions and changes.

	* sys1.unx, sys3.unx, sys5.unx, uux.c, uucp.c, uucico.c, copy.c,
	uucp.h, system.h: create directories when necessary rather than
	assuming that they exist.  Added fmkdirs argument to esysdep_fopen
	and fcopy_file, changing all calls.  Added fpublic argument to
	fsysdep_make_dirs, changing all calls.  Moved fsysdep_make_dirs
	and fsdirectory_exists from sys3.unx to sys1.unx.  Added checks
	for ENOENT in several places in sys3.unx and sys5.unx.

	* log.c, port.c (fport_open), sys2.unx (fsserial_open): added
	ulog_device routine to record device name.  This is currently only
	used for the BNU statistics file, but more uses might arise later.

	* file.c, log.c, uucp.h: moved statistics file routines from
	file.c to log.c in preparation for supporting BNU log file
	routines.

Mon Dec  9 12:00:52 1991  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* bnu.c (ubnu_read_systems): Arne Ludwig: the device entry for a
	system can be followed by a comma and a list of protocols.

	* sysh.unx, sys3.unx (fsdo_lock): Richard Todd: add
	HAVE_V2_LOCKFILES, in which the process ID is written out in
	binary.

	* uuxqt.c (uqdo_xqt_file): Richard Todd: the requestor address is
	relative to the requesting system.

	* config.c (uprocesscmds, umulti_pushback): Richard Todd: each
	line pushed back because of "#" is local to a particular
	smulti_file structure.

	* prtinf.c (asPdialer_cmds): Richard Todd: exit the current dialer
	if the special command "#" is seen.  A similar thing should be put
	in for ports, but it's marginally more complex.

	* config.c (uprocesscmds): Richard Todd: don't warn if the special
	"#" command is unrecognized.

Sat Dec  7 13:05:40 1991  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* config.c (uprocesscmds): Franc,ois Pinard: don't limit the
	number of arguments to a command!

	* chat.c (fchat): handle a chat script which consists only of a
	single string.

Fri Dec  6 16:11:29 1991  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* sys5.unx (fsysdep_execute): David J. Fiander: if execve fails
	with ENOEXEC, try using /bin/sh with a quoted argument.

	* uux.c (main): split arguments the way /bin/sh does.  If any
	shell metacharacters appears, request uuxqt to execute the command
	using /bin/sh.

	* tstuu.c (uprepare_test): allow the uux to test to send a failure
	message.

	* uuxqt.c (uqdo_xqt_file): don't send mail on successful execution
	unless specifically requested; pay attention to the 'n' line
	which requests mail on success; ignore the 'Z' line because it
	now specifies the default action.

	* sys1.unx (usysdep_initialize), sys6.unx (zsysdep_add_cwd):
	Franc,ois Pinard: getcwd may legitimately fail, so only give an
	error if we really need the result.

	* chat.c (ccescape): Franc,ois Pinard: ccescape should never
	return a negative number, since the callers don't know how to deal
	with that.

Mon Dec  2 16:26:16 1991  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* bnu.c (ubnu_read_systems): Dave Buck: time strings with grades
	were parsed in an endless loop!

	* sys3.unx (fsdo_lock, fsdo_unlock): the alloca when using LOCKDIR
	was one byte too small.

	* config.c (tprocess_one_cmd): pass 10 to strtol rather than 0 to
	avoid surprises if a leading zero is used.

	* prtinf.c (tpproto_param, tpdialer_proto_param): Niels Baggesen:
	the ``protocol-parameter'' command didn't work for ports or
	dialers.

Sun Dec  1 09:46:12 1991  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* tstuu.c: don't use the fd_set typedef at all.

	* tstuu.c (uprepare_test): don't read V2 or BNU configuration
	files while testing.

	* bnu.c, v2.c, config.c (uread_config): David Nugent: even if the
	code was compiled with HAVE_TAYLOR_CONFIG, read the V2 and BNU
	configuration files if the code was compiled to support them.

	* uuchk.c (fkshow_port): Bob Izenberg: report dialer/token pairs
	correctly.

Sat Nov 30 17:40:00 1991  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* tstuu.c: Bob Izenberg: copied over conditional definitions of
	EAGAIN and EWOULDBLOCK from sys2.unx.

	* bnu.c (fbnu_read_dialer_info): Niels Baggesen: accept dialers
	with no substitutions.

	* bnu.c (ubnu_read_systems, ubadd_perm): Niels Baggesen: don't
	free up zline in ubadd_perm; in fact, changed the calling sequence
	to not even pass zline in at all.

	* bnu.c (ubadd_perm): Niels Baggesen: didn't handle multiple
	MACHINE= and multiple LOGNAME= values in a single Permissions
	line, because it was clobbering the machine name while processing
	the first logname.

	* bnu.c: Made zread and zwrite elements of sperm structure const
	char * to avoid warning.

	* copy.c, sys1.unx, sys2.unx, sys3.unx, sys5.unx, tstuu.c: Niels
	Baggesen: don't multiply include <unistd.h>.  Eventually there
	should be a macro controlling whether it gets included at all, for
	non-POSIX systems.

	* sys3.unx (fsysdep_get_status, isysdep_get_sequence): Marty
	Shannon: accept a truncated status file.  I also eliminated scanf
	calls in sys3.unx, since that was the only place it was called;
	this was to make the executables smaller for systems which cared.

	* bnu.c (ubnu_read_sysfiles): Marty Shannon: accept comment
	characters in Sysfiles.

	* sysh.unx, sys3.unx: Marty Shannon: added HAVE_RENAME, put a fake
	rename system call in sys3.unx.

	* prtinf.c (ffind_port): Marty Shannon: failed to handle multiple
	ports in the port file since I forgot to reset my pointer
	variable.

	* bnu.c (ubnu_read_systems): Marty Shannon: don't initialize the
	auto array abpubdir, since old cc didn't permit initialization of
	auto aggregates.

Mon Nov 25 20:56:39 1991  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* tstuu.c: Bob Denny: add definitions for FD_SET, FD_ZERO and
	FD_ISSET.

	* config.c: Bob Denny: add explicit externs for strcmp and
	strcasecmp.

	* sys2.unx: the fread_blocking and fwrite_blocking fields were
	not getting initialized correctly in the TCP support routines.

	* sysh.unx, sys2.unx, sys5.unx, tstuu.c: Marty Shannon: added
	configuration option HAVE_SYSWAIT_H.

	* bnu.c (fbnu_find_port, fbnu_read_dialer_info), v2.c
	(fv2_find_port): Marty Shannon: the ireliable field of ports
	and dialers was	not getting initialized.

Sun Nov 24 15:06:37 1991  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian at comton.airs.com)

	* tcp.c (itcp_port_number): Michael Haberler: wasn't calling
	htons if passed a numeric string.
